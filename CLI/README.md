# Overview

I wrote a simple command line interface for rust. This was to familiarize myself with simple Rust modules like fs and io (filesystem and input/output). This was also done to help me to gain familiarity with the rust language. I have also wanted to work on manipulating files more, and this allowed me to accomplish the objective of learning rust and working with file creation and deletion.

# Development Environment

I used vscode and the cargo build tool with rust to build this software. Cargo compiles rust code at run time and creates a cargo.toml file and other necessary files to manage dependencies and build your code. I used the std module for rust.

# Future Work

- Expand filesystem abilities by allowing opening and editing of files.
- Expand navigation by allowing user to navigate various directories.
- Improve UI by opening a terminal in a separate window and constantly displaying current directory
