# Overview

My goal with this GitHub repository is to contain in an organized manner the projects I will fulfill during my self-teaching of programming. First, I needed to acquaint myself with Git, in-line Git commands, and Github as a repository. I find command-line "coding" fascinating and enjoy learning about it. I have also engaged in several projects, including a Pokemon-API project to help me learn how to handle promises, responses, and calls to an API. I also engaged in this project to help me implement basic UI elements and dynamically generated content through JavaScript, while solidifying my JavaScript knowledge. Other programs will follow suit, where I will execute on creating a program that is designed to help me solidify my knowledge and skills as a programmer. 

Thus far, I have included a basic "Hello, World" program and intend to accumulate more projects (I intend to add my Pokemon project and project interacting with a server soon).

I created this "Hello, World" project as a means to start my professional GitHub repository.
